## Overview

This document explains who the maintainers are (see below), what they do in this repo, and how they should be doing it. If you're interested in contributing, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Current Maintainers

| Maintainer               | GitHub ID                               | Affiliation |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Henri Yandell            | [hyandell](https://github.com/hyandell) | Amazon      |
| Daniel "dB." Doubrovkine | [dblock](https://github.com/dblock)     | Amazon      |

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are active and visible members of the community, and have [maintain-level permissions on a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization). Use those privileges to serve the community and evolve code as follows.

### Uphold Code of Conduct

Model the behavior set forward by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and raise any violations to other maintainers and admins.

### Prioritize Security

Security is your number one priority. Maintainer's Github keys must be password protected securely and any reported security vulnerabilities are addressed before features or bugs.

Note that this repository is monitored and supported 24/7 by Amazon Security, see [Reporting a Vulnerability](SECURITY.md) for details.

### Review Pull Requests

Review pull requests regularly, comment, suggest, reject, merge and close. Accept only high quality pull-requests. Provide code reviews and guidance on incomming pull requests. Don't let PRs be stale and do your best to be helpful to contributors.

### Triage Open Issues

Manage labels, review issues regularly, and triage by labelling them. 

All repositories in this organization have a standard set of labels, including `bug`, `documentation`, `duplicate`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `blocker`, `invalid`, `question`, `wontfix`, and `untriaged`, along with release labels, such as `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`, `patch`, and `backport`.

Use labels to target an issue or a PR for a given release, add `help wanted` to good issues for new community members, and `blocker` for issues that scare you or need immediate attention. Request for more information from a submitter if an issue is not clear. Create new labels as needed by the project.

### Be Responsive

Respond to enhancement requests, and forum posts. Allocate time to reviewing and commenting on issues and conversations as they come in. 

### Maintain Overall Health of the Repo

Keep the `main` branch at production quality at all times. Backport features as needed. Cut release branches and tags to enable future patches. 

### Add Continuous Integration Checks

Add integration checks that validate pull requests and pushes to ease the burden on Pull Request reviewers.

#### Developer Certificate of Origin Workflow

Validates pull requests commits are all signed with DCO, [dco.yml](./workflow/dco.yml).  Example [pull request](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ci/pull/16).

### Use Semver

Use and enforce [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and do not let breaking changes be made outside of major releases.

### Release Frequently

Make frequent project releases to the community.

### Promote Other Maintainers

Assist, add, and remove [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md). Exercise good judgement, and propose high quality contributors to become co-maintainers. See [Becoming a Maintainer](#becoming-a-maintainer) for more information.

### Describe the Repo

Make sure the repo has a well-written, accurate, and complete description. See [opensearch-project/.github#38](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/issues/38) for some helpful tips to describe your repo.

## Becoming a Maintainer

You can become a maintainer by actively [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to any project, and being nominated by an existing maintainer.

### Nomination

Any current maintainer starts an e-mail thread (until we have a better mechanism, e-mails can usually be found via MAINTAINERS.md + DCO) with all other maintainers on that repository to discuss nomination using the template below. In order to be approved, at least 3 positive maintainer votes are necessary, and no vetoes. In rare cases when there are less than 3 maintainers, the positive votes from all maintainers are required. Any disagreements can be escalated to the repo admin.

The nomination should clearly identify the person with their real name and a link to their GitHub profile, and the rationale for the nomination, with concrete example contributions.

### Interest

Upon receiving at least 3 positive maintainer votes, and no vetoes, from other maintainers within a maximum period of 2 weeks, the nominating maintainer asks a potential nominee whether they might be interested in becoming a maintainer on the repository, which typically happens via e-mail obtained via DCO, but may also be a comment to a pull request, following a substantial contribution.

> This is great work! Based on your ongoing contributions to the project we have decided that we'd like to invite you to become a co-maintainer for this project. Please let us know whether you accept this nomination.

Individuals accept the nomination by replying, or commenting, for example _"Thank you! I would love to."_

### Public Confirmation

Upon receiving 3 positive maintainer votes, and no vetoes, from other maintainers, and after having confirmed interest with the nominee, the maintainer opens a pull request adding the proposed co-maintainer to MAINTAINERS.md, and perform a final vote similar to the nomination process. If the nomination still has 3 positive votes, and no vetoes, from other maintainers, the nomination is accepted. The positive maintainer voters should approve the pull request to show support.

> _Content from the above nomination._
> 
> Here is my +1.
> 
> If you support this nomination, please add your +1 or a comment. 
> 
> If you do not support this nomination, we invite you to e-mail all/some of the current [project maintainers](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) in the next 2 weeks. We will keep your feedback private to this group and discuss offline. We will not publicly post the reasons for a decision not to add this co-maintainer, or publicize your name. 
> 
> Anyone, including maintainers, can publicly add +1s as requested in the nomination issue if they support the nomination or contact the maintainers in private if they oppose. The pull request stays open for 2 weeks.

### Maintainer Decision

If a positive decision has been reached, the nomination is accepted. If the maintainers cannot reach a positive decision for any reason, the nomination is rejected with _"a decision could not be reached"_ with no further explanation necessary, and the pull request is closed.

### Adding a New Maintainer

The repo admin adjusts the new maintainerâ€™s permissions accordingly, and merges the pull request to MAINTAINERS.md.

## Removing a Maintainer

Removing a maintainer is a disruptive action that the community of maintainers should not undertake lightly. There are several reasons a maintainer might be removed from the project, such as inactivity, or taking actions that negatively impact the project.

### Moving On

There are plenty of reasons that might cause someone to want to take a step back or even a hiatus from a project. Existing maintainers can choose to leave the project at any time, with or without reason, by making a pull request to move themselves to the "Emeritus" section of MAINTAINERS.md, and asking an admin to remove their permissions.

### Inactivity

Maintainer status never expires. If a maintainer becomes inactive for a time (usually several months), the repo admin may revoke maintainer level access to the repository for security reasons. A maintainer can reach out to the repo admin to get their permissions reinstated.

If the repo is left without any maintainers, either by maintainer inactivity or moving on, the repo is considered unmaintained. The repo admin will seek out new maintainers and note the maintenance status in the repo README file.

### Negative Impact on the Project

Actions that negatively impact the project will be handled by the admins, in coordination with other maintainers, in balance with the urgency of the issue. Examples would be [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations, deliberate harmful actions, and security risks.
